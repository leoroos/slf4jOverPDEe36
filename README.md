#SLF4J over PDE logging

A plug-in that pipes log statements generated using the slf4j API to the PDE logging level.
This plug-in is an adjusted version of what John J. Franey discussed on [EclipseZone](http://eclipse.dzone.com/)
in his article [Universal Logger Plug-ins for RCP Applications](http://www.eclipsezone.com/articles/franey-logging/).
